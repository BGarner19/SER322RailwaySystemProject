# SER322 Railway System Project - Team 6

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP THE DATABASE

1. You must add postgresql-42.2.2.jar to the classpath. 
2. This program uses an installation of PostgreSQL 10.3, which can be downloaded as an installer at www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
3. This program was created using an installation of PostgreSQL running on port 5432. Running it on a different port will require changing the call in Start.java to use a different port
4. You must create a database in pgAdmin 4. Create a database using the statement CREATE DATABASE Team6RailwayDB
5. Note that the program's main method defaults to a database name of Team6RailwayDB. You may create a different named database by changing the call to use your database name. 
6. This program uses the default installation user "postgres" with a password of "322". This can be set in the database constructor parameters. 
7. Run the main method in Start.java. The GUI should open and you should find that the database is created and filled with sample data in pgAdmin 4.
